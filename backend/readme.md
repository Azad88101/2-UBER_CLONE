## Notes

- The endpoint is validated using [`express-validator`](https://express-validator.github.io/docs/).
- Passwords are hashed using [`bcrypt`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) before being stored in the database.
- The returned JWT token is generated by an instance method in the [`User` model](backend/models/user.model.js).
