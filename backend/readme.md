# User Profile & Logout Endpoints Documentation

## 1. Get User Profile

**Endpoint:** `GET /user/profile`

**Description:**  
Retrieves the profile details of the currently logged-in user. This endpoint is protected and requires a valid JWT (provided via cookies or the `Authorization` header).

**Authentication:**

- The user must be authenticated.
- Middleware verifies the JWT and attaches the user object to `req.user`.

**Example Request:**

```
GET /user/profile
Cookie: token=your_jwt_token_here
```

**Responses:**

- **200 OK**  
  Returns the logged-in user's data.

  ```json
  {
    "success": true,
    "user": {
      "_id": "user id",
      "fullname": {
        "firstname": "John",
        "lastname": "Doe"
      },
      "email": "john.doe@example.com",
      "password": "hashed password"
    }
  }
  ```

- **401 Unauthorized**  
  If the user is not authenticated or token is invalid/missing.
  ```json
  {
    "message": "Unauthorized"
  }
  ```

---

## 2. Logout

**Endpoint:** `GET /user/logout`

**Description:**  
Logs out the user by clearing the authentication cookie and blacklisting the current JWT token so it can no longer be used.

**Example Request:**

```
GET /user/logout
Cookie: token=your_jwt_token_here
```

**Responses:**

- **200 OK**  
  Indicates the user has been logged out successfully.

  ```json
  {
    "message": "Logged out succesfully"
  }
  ```

- **401 Unauthorized**  
  In case of issues with the token (e.g., if not provided or already invalidated by middleware in related endpoints).

---

## Notes

- The `/user/profile` endpoint is protected by authentication middleware.
- On logout, the token is cleared from the cookies and stored in a blacklist to prevent further use.
